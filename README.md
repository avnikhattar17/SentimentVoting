# SentimentVoting- .sol
This project implements a decentralized voting system in Solidity where real-time sentiment analysis influences the weight of each vote. Unlike traditional voting where every vote carries equal value, this system adjusts vote weight dynamically based on a continuously updated sentiment score that reflects public mood or market trends.

The sentiment score acts as a real-time parameter that changes through oracle-like updates â€” simulating how collective public sentiment can amplify or diminish the impact of votes. For instance, during positive sentiment, votes carry higher weight, while negative sentiment reduces their influence.
